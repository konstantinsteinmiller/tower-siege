/**
 * ─── Leaderboard client ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Talks to the Cloudflare Worker in `worker/`. Every call is optional: if the
 * endpoint is unset, unreachable, slow or broken, the game carries on and the
 * death screen simply shows no rank. A leaderboard is a garnish — it may never
 * be able to block, delay or break a run.
 *
 * Two rules keep the free tier comfortable, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *   * **Read once.** The board is fetched when nothing is cached, and reused
 *     from memory afterwards. It is a top-100 of a game the player is playing,
 *     not a live feed — it does not need to be current to the second.
 *   * **Write only on a personal record.** Submitting every run would spend the
 *     scarce quota (writes) on rows that change nothing, since the table stores
 *     one personal best per player.
