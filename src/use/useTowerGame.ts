 * Owns the tower, the enemies, the projectiles and the wave clock. Runs on a
 * fixed 60 Hz accumulator so behaviour is frame-rate independent and a
 * backgrounded tab can't fast-forward the siege on return.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE CONTRACT: the hot collections (`blocks`, `enemies`,
 * `projectiles`) are PLAIN, non-reactive structures. Vue's proxy overhead on a
 * few hundred entities mutated 60×/s is exactly the kind of cost that makes a
 * mobile browser drop frames. Only HUD-relevant SCALARS are refs, and they are
 * written at most once per tick. The renderer reads the plain collections
 * directly via the exported accessors.
 *
 * World space: cell `(c, r)` spans `x ∈ [c-0.5, c+0.5]`, `y ∈ [r, r+1]`, with
 * `y = 0` on the ground and `+y` pointing UP. The Gate sits at `(0, 0)`.
